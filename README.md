% Numerical example for the manuscript
% "Distributed saddle-point subgradient algorithms with Laplacian
% averaging", by
% D. Mateos-Núñez and J. Cortés, 2016

% Some parts are adapted from 
% "Primal Recovery from Consensus-Based Dual Decomposition for Distributed
% Convex Optimization", by
% Andrea Simonetto and Hadi Jamali-Rad

% The main script is "ExampleLogConstraints_comparison_rates.m"

% This script uses the following helper functions
% "test1_optimtool" (which uses "constraint_mytest" and "objective_mytest"),
% "theoretical_bound_func"
% "smallw"
% "learnrate_doubling_trick"
