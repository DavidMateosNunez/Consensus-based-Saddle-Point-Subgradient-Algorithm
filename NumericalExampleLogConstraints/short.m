function S = short(A,p)

%SHORT      Randomly add entries (shortcuts) to a matrix
%
%   Input   A: n by n adjacency matrix
%           p: probability that an entry is added to a given row
%
%   Output  S: n by n adjacency matrix with the attribute sparse.
%
%   Description:    A symmetric matrix of shortcuts is created which has
%                   an entry in each row with independent probability p.
%                   This is added to the matrix A.
%
%   Example: S = short(A,0.3);

n = length(A);

if nargin == 1
    p = log(n)/n;
